Our objective is to augment the current OpenCilk framework by integrating memory optimizations into the parallel-for (referred to as "Do-all loop") code generation. OpenCilk, an open-source parallel programming library, has its origins in Cilk, a language extension to C designed to simplify parallel programming.
